# SQL_Query_Excecution-
This module is intended to select data from an already existing table and display results to the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The expected output is a wizard displayed to the user to specify the query through filling certain fields (example: what table to apply the query on, what fields you need to put conditions on, etc.)
2) The specified query would be applied to the saved data and the results would be shown to the user.
3) Types of queries to be covered:
• Comparison queries (=, !=, >, < , in)
• Aggregate functions (sum, average, etc.)
• Queries using Boolean operators (And, Or)
Notes:
• The data stored in the table should be kept in XML files
• The module should accept any file (i.e. it should not be specific for a single table)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
SQL Query Processing: in addition to the wizard the module could accept simple SQL queries, process them and return the result.
